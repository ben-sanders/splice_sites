Uses the refseq exon list to extract the sequence around splice sites matching the ranges used in the 1987 Shapiro and Senapathy splice-site models.
These models are still commonly used - but how have they stood up to time? There is no vastly more sequence information available.
This analysis uses 201989 of each type of site, from human RefSeq transcripts, to recreate the probability matrices S&S created from 540ish primate sequences.

Runs as an automated pipeline - just run:
	$ ./<path_to_script>/s_and_s_calculation.sh <refseq_file>

NOTE: Due to calls within the script, it should only be run from within the shapiro_senepathy_comparison

The script will generate probability matrices and representative 100 sequence FASTA files that can be used with online sequence logo generators

models generated are very similar to the S&S originals.

There are some non-canonical splice sites - do they have similarities?
	File were split into canonical and nonstandard sites using grep to remove non GT/AG sites
	very little similarity in these sequences - presumably there are other features?
Not too many sites though:
 	652 nonstandard acceptors
	1046 nonstandard donors
vs. >200,000 of each canonical site
These relative numbers mean that the nonstandard sites have no effect on the overall models, but they can be considered separately.
