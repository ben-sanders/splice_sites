BED files of all human splice sites.
Extracted from UCSC table browser (
 table ‘refGene’ from the track ‘RefSeq Genes’, and the group ‘Gen

02_make_exon_list.sh generates a fasta file of sequences 100bp sequences around refseq splice sites, this format is not compatible with 
alamut batch.

Is there a way to force alamut to run without and alt allele? e.g. to jsut report on the REF sequence, without any score change etc.? 
Probably not, although could perhaps run with the same allele duplicated?
