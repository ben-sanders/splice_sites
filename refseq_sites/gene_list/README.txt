This folder contains the list of RefSeq genes, refgenes.txt.

Downloaded from the UCSC table browser
??exact details are in writeup??

This file contains the identifiers, names, location, and exon positions of every
RefSeq transcript.
The exon coordinates are extracted using ../../scripts/getrefseqexons.py
The script takes no arguments, so the filename has to be specified within the script.
Output is to stdout, and so can be piped to whatever file you want.
