PROCESS

some can be scritped at one go - which?
sequences may need to be collected separately
    e.g. using bedtools getfasta

Ideally, all variants should have the same information (as much as possible)

Literature database variants
* should contain all necessary information
* so can be added straight away via. script

Refseq splice sites
* Don't have an alt, as the are wild-type sites
* Duplicate REF as ALT when creating?

Random sequences
* Only have sequence data
* ID can be generated
* No chromosome, position, etc. as not taken from human genome
* therefore may not work in alamut batch...
* May need to rethink random approach
 * Perhaps use refseq positions as exclusion? Pick a bunch of random sites x nucleotides minimum away from these?
