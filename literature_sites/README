Raw folder contains the sources of the variants - papers and supporting files from papers.

variantdb.xls constains all variants taken from the literature (probably worth doing a slight expansion if poss)
literature_variants_with_header.txt is a tab separated dump of variantdb.xls, including column headers. It is used
to create the SQL upload script to add the variants to the database.

For all subsequent use, the variants are taken from the main database, not the literature variant database.
